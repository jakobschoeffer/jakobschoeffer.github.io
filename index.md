Hi there! I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Texas at Austin, working closely with Maria De-Arteaga. Broadly speaking, I am interested in problems that arise when humans and AI systems interact; specifically around transparency and fairness in human-AI collaborative decision-making.
