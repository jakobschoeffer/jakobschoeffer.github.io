Hi there! I am currently a 3rd-year PhD student at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany. Broadly speaking, I am interested in problems that arise when humans and algorithms interact; specifically around fairness and transparency in AI-based decision-making. Most recently, I have been conducting behavioral experiments to assess how explanations impact (i) people's fairness perceptions, (ii) their reliance on AI, and (iii) fairness of outcomes in AI-based decision-making settings.
