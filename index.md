Hi there! I am currently a 4th-year PhD student at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany. Broadly speaking, I am interested in problems that arise when humans and algorithms interact; specifically around fairness and transparency in AI-informed decision-making. Most recently, I have been conducting behavioral experiments to assess how explanations impact (i) people's fairness perceptions, (ii) their reliance on AI recommendations, and (iii) fairness of outcomes in human-AI decision-making.
